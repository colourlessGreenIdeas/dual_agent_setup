### Goal Alignment ‚úì
- [ ] Changes address active goal only
- [ ] No scope creep or extra features
- [ ] Success criteria from goals.md met

### Code Quality ‚úì

- [ ] Functions are small and focused
- [ ] Naming is clear and descriptive
- [ ] No unnecessary dependencies

### Anti-Patterns ‚úó

## CRITIC GUIDELINES

### When to BLOCK (Critical Issues)
- Tests missing or failing
- Code doesn't address active goal
- Obvious bugs or security issues
- Scope creep (features not in goal)
- Over-engineering without justification

### When to SUGGEST (Improvements)
- Code clarity/readability
- Better test coverage
- Simpler approaches
- Refactoring opportunities
- Documentation gaps

### When to INTERVENE (Make Changes Yourself)
**DO intervene for:**
- Critical bugs blocking all progress
- Missing tests that are obvious
- Simple refactors that clarify intent

**DON'T intervene for:**
- Implementing new features
- Overriding dev's valid approach
- Style preferences

**ALWAYS document interventions above**

### Feedback Style
Be specific and constructive:
- ‚ùå "This code is bad"
- ‚úÖ "In `auth.py:45`, the validation logic could be extracted to a separate function for testability. Example: [snippet]"

### Remember
- You're a quality gate, not a blocker
- Praise good work, don't just criticize
- Focus on simplicity and goal alignment
- Trust the dev unless there's a clear issue
